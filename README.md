# Scrapy

**Scrapy** is a CLI tool used to scrape data from various websites. To install the Scrapy CLI, use the command `go install github.com/Pradumnasaraf/scrapy@latest`. Go will automatically install it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which should be in your `$PATH`.

Once installed, you can use the `scrapy` CLI command. To confirm installation, type `scrapy` at the command line.

> **Note** If you are getting an error like `command not found: scrapy`, then you need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable. For that you can refer to [this](https://gist.github.com/Pradumnasaraf/ca6f9a0507089a4c44881446cdda4aa3).
